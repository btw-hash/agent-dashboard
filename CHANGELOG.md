- Side panel font tweaks; mood emoji now shown on change only (`ux`)
- Polish pass: fonts, agent scale, overlaps, window clipping, panel alignment
- Sprint approve/revert moved to GitHub API; feedback read from Railway URL (`refactor(sprint)`)
- Sky FX aligned with window range `[1,33]`; foosball / GIF export restored (`fix(windows)+feat`)

### Fixed

- Antigravity audit findings — 7 bugs (`fix`)
- Foosball `scoreLock` prevents +50 per goal when ball stayed in goal area for 900ms
- Missing `OX_RIGHT` constant left canvas blank
- Consolidated batch: windows, NPC sidestep, vending duplication, 3D printer, sprint pipeline
- Windows: sky now fills entire pane, mullion cross redrawn on top
- Windows: sky/animations aligned with window frame (inner rect)
- Right panel: force CW recompute on boot so it sits flush with wall
- Right panel was drawing over the office wall
- Mood emoji shown 10 seconds after change (was 1.7s)
- Whiteboard minigame: card face never visible after flip
- Side panels, couch gap, gym overlaps, jukebox clipping, minigame fixes
- Entertainment-zone layout cleanup: walls, disco, slots, jukebox
- Relocated 6 visual conflicts in entertainment zone
- Weather clipping, windows, text and overlap batch audit
- Sprint: wrap `npx`/`node` in `call` so `.bat` doesn't die after claude exits
- URL query-string stripping for `railway-webhook` route + CJS require in sprint-track
- Telegram: await async `approveSprint` / `revertSprint` in callback handler
- Added missing `demo.js` handler to git (was accidentally in `.gitignore`)
